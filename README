QUADStor VTL installation guide

Prerequistes
------------

On FreeBSD 8.x/9.x:

pkg_add -r sudo apache22 gmake 
Additionally the kernel source /usr/sys/sys needs to be present

On RHEL/CentOS 5.x/6.x:

yum install httpd gcc perl kernel-devel sg3_utils

On SLES 11 SP1/SP2:

zypper install apache2 gcc perl kernel-default-devel sg3_utils

On Debian 6.x/7.x:

apt-get install uuid-runtime
apt-get install build-essential
apt-get install sg3-utils
apt-get install apache2
apt-get install psmisc
apt-get install firmware-qlogic (for FC access)
apt-get install linux-headers-{uname}
where {uname} can be got from the command 'uname -r'

If you have installed any of the release packages before, then you most likely have all the prerequistes installed.

git clone --branch opensource https://github.com/quadstor/quadstorvtl.git quadstorvtl

You could also download the source from https://github.com/quadstor/quadstorvtl
(Download ZIP button on the right)

cd quadstorvtl (or the directory which gets unpacked)

On RHEL/CentOS 6.x:
./installworld rhel6

On RHEL/CentOS 5.x:
./installworld rhel5

./installworld sles11

On FreeBSD 9.x
./installworld bsd9

On FreeBSD 8.x
./installworld bsd

For other distributions, choose the method closest from the above. For example for FC19 ./installworld rhel6 should work

Uninstallation
--------------

Go back to the location where the sources were built and run
./uninstallworld

uninstallworld removes most of the installed files except for custom configurationf files like /quadstorvtl/etc/quadstor.conf and the postgresql database data files under /quadstorvtl/pgsql/data. These will have to be manually removed if you are clearing out an installation. 
NOTE: /quadstorvtl/pgdata contains the configuration database of the software. This data is maintained even after an uninstall of the software and is required during upgrades. If this data were to manually removed all previous configuration such as configured storage, VTL information etc is lost. Refer to http://www.quadstor.com/support/131-recovering-from-a-lost-or-damaged-database.html to recover from a lost or damage database
